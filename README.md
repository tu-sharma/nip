- National ID Integration Portal is an application that is fulfilled with SDU [Smart Doc. Understanding] feature. This feature is an ability to understand relevant information of documents and learn from annotation or past experiences that processed through Watson Discovery an IBM Cloud Service. In the end, it forms as a  bot / virtual assistant that helps into customer services by its trained knowledge that has driven from different learning paths (Watson Assistant, Cloud Functions). 

- Bots are a new technological approach that frames a new conversational world. The newest invention connects a world like well-connected threads. Here Bots has a lot to contribute because it’s conversational behavior that helps every service provider. Service is the most important part of service-based firms. Infect, In populous countries, service is the biggest issue because service needs some basic necessities and resources as well as people and time.  
- Bots can help as a better service-man or virtual assistant that helps the number of customers who can’t connect to firms due to lack of communication between company and customer. So, Bots are very intelligent and best learners to understand or gather the relevant information on the specific scenarios. For eg: Giving Appointments, Office locations, or Provide info of Product.


## PROPOSED METHODOLOGY
Our Idea is to respond to this problem by the National ID integration portal that helps every citizen to access the customer services of their relevant Identity queries. NIP Assistant is a bot that learns about ID's and the several details to help people. Users can ask the question to a bot like Queries about aadhaar. Future Scope: It will also help to access the direct details from Govt. official data and also provide other direct, indirect services.
To make the bots up to the merits of customer service, we have to add more features by bots learning grows up and they learn from its experiences. This is possible through IBM Watson Services. Watson Service is of many types in that Discovery is service that helps to learn and provide a smart understanding to target systems like bots.


IBM Watson Discovery process structured, semi-structured and unstructured data to do Watson training on targeted documents. Natural Language Processing makes this happens with different supported formats by Watson Discovery. To improve the trained model we have to do some more efforts like annotate the document with some useful levels. 

## SPECIFICATIONS
### General Specification
It is a conversational cloud-based chatbot for provide serving in respect of National ID. It based on communication robots based on communication trees and NLP models.
Bot services connected to specific communication channels.

The IBM Cloud is used to run the entire solution, Design, and chatbot also its backend is separate groups that working separately. The Backend of Chatbot is designed on the Node.js and the webhook link is used to integrate the actual decision features to the chatbot. Assistant can develop their own knowledge base via fetch the relevant details as a schedule of 1 week’s time. This virtual assistant updated its memory every 12 Hours to refresh the data linked with the knowledge base.



The Decision and Query have a relation with Intent and entities. When Chatbot train with the intents then that able to understand the user intent and get what the user wants to say??

We include web drive to automated accessible sites that can help the user to fetch their requested information on one platform without going through multiple sites.
 - A System that prepared on the basis of common souring and delivery. It kind of fun when data fetch is easy because of the conversational approach.
